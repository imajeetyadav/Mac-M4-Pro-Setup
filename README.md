# Mac-M4-Pro-Setup

[Zsh Plugin Manager](https://github.com/zplug/zplug)

### This script is designed to setup MAC M4 Pro.  

### You won’t need Xcode to use Homebrew, but some of the software and components you’ll want to install will rely on Xcode’s Command Line Tools package.
``` xcode-select --install ```

## Install Brew 
### install homebrew
``` curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh ```

### Set Path ( Note - Please change the username before use )
``` echo 'eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> /Users/ajeet/.zprofile ```

### install cask
``` brew install cask```
### To check brew status 
``` brew doctor ```
### homebrew cask updater: https://github.com/buo/homebrew-cask-upgrade
``` brew tap buo/cask-upgrade ```

## add additional repos for homebrew to track, update & install
### add cask-drivers
``` brew tap homebrew/cask-drivers ```
### add fonts
``` brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts ```

### install git
``` brew install git```

### install Z-Shell
``` brew install zsh```

## OH MY ZSH
### install
``` sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)" ```

### The installation script should set zsh to your default shell, but if it doesn't you can do it manually
``` chsh -s $(which zsh) ```

### To apply the changes you make you need to either start new shell instance or run
``` source ~/.zshrc ```

### zsh-syntax-highlighting
``` git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting ```

You can also display the app switcher on all monitors with the following undocumented preference:
```
defaults write com.apple.dock appswitcher-all-displays -bool true
killall Dock
```
This works on Monterey, Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave, and possibly older versions as well.
